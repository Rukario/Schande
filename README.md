# Schande
DIY scraper, download and organize

Made for Windows 10 with Python 3 and Visual Studio 2017 installed, but any OS with Python 3 installed should work.

Start guide
1. Check and change the file extension back to .bat if it's in something else.
2. Launch it and read the CLI message. Other systems must launch it through Terminal, e.g. for MacOS:

```
open /Applications/Python\ 3.9/Install\ Certificates.command
sudo python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
sudo python3 -m pip install PySocks
sudo python3 -m pip install opencv-python
sudo python3 -m pip install numpy
sudo python3 -m pip install Pillow
python3 -x /drag/n/drop/the/batchfile
```

3. Browse new files in file explorer and don't be a silly Hydrus user!
