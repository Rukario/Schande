Any good OS with Python 3 installed will work. iOS/iPadOS: get iSH Shell app from https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ish-shell/id1436902243 then enter `apk add py3-pip`. MacOS need one more step after installing Python: open Terminal and enter `open /Applications/Python\ 3.9/Install\ Certificates.command`

1. Follow one for your system:
 > Windows: Change the file extension back to .bat if it's in something else, then double click on it and read the CLI message.

 > Linux/MacOS (Terminal):
```
python3 -x /drag/n/drop/the/batchfile
```

 > iOS/iPadOS (iSH Shell app)
```
cat /dev/location > /dev/null &
mount -t ios . /mnt
python3 -x /mnt/batchfile
```

2. Schande.bat on first run will create a new file: Schande.cd, open it in your favorite text editor and add a rule there (to establish your capabilities to open and edit it), refer to the premade Schande.cd for inspiration.
