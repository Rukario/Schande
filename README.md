Any good OS with Python 3 installed will work.

1. Follow one for your system:
 > Windows: Change the file extension back to .bat if it's in something else, then double click on it and read the CLI message.

 > MacOS (Terminal):
```
open /Applications/Python\ 3.9/Install\ Certificates.command
sudo python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
sudo python3 -m pip install PySocks
sudo python3 -m pip install Pillow
python3 -x /drag/n/drop/the/batchfile
```

 > Linux (Terminal):
```
pip install --user PySocks
pip install --user Pillow
some command like "python -x" to this file but dunno myself, you linux guys can figure it out.
```

2. Schande.bat on first run will create a new file: Schande.cd, open it in your favorite text editor and add a rule there (to establish your capabilities to open and edit it), refer to the premade Schande.cd for inspiration.
